- The assembly consists of a **direct starter** used for the motors.  
- As safety elements, in the control circuit, we have the emergency switch, the stop button and the overload relay.  
- Furthermore, as an additional safety to prevent direct contact with the conductors, the panel has a limit switch that detects when the door is open, stopping the entire power system.  
- For the direct start, it is enough to verify that none of the safety measures mentioned above are active, and we will only have to press the start button.  
- In the upper part of the cabinet there are cable glands through which we will take out the cables to connect the receptors.  
- **The system does not have residual current protection, so we will have to feed it from a panel that does have residual current protection.**
